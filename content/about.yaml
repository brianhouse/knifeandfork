  Since 2004, [Brian House](https://brianhouse.net) and [Sue Huang](http://www.sue-huang.com/) have worked together as Knifeandfork. Culture guide Flavorpill writes, "the imaginative bicoastal duo['s] installations utilize unorthodox media, including text messages and video clips, in their expository repositioning of traditional art forms." Knifeandfork has exhibited at MOCA, Los Angeles; the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati; Rhizome at the New Museum, New York; the Beall Center for Art + Technology, Irvine; and Kulturhuset, Stockholm, among others. House holds a PhD in computer music and multimedia from Brown University, and he is currently a Mellon Associate Research Scholar at Columbia GSAPPâ€™s Center for Spatial Research. Huang is currently an Assistant Professor of Digital Media and Design at the University of Connecticut and holds an MFA in media arts from UCLA.
