  Since 2004, [Brian House](https://brianhouse.net) and [Sue Huang](http://www.sue-huang.com/) have worked together as Knifeandfork. Culture guide Flavorpill writes, "the imaginative bicoastal duo['s] installations utilize unorthodox media, including text messages and video clips, in their expository repositioning of traditional art forms." Knifeandfork has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles; the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC), Cincinnati; Rhizome at the New Museum, New York; the Beall Center for Art + Technology, Irvine; and Kulturhuset, Stockholm, among others. House is currently an Assistant Professor of Art and studio head of Digital Media at Lewis & Clark College, and he holds a PhD in Computer Music from Brown University. Huang is currently an Assistant Professor of Digital Media and Design at the University of Connecticut and holds an MFA in Media Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles.
