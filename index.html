    <h2>Oh Dear Me (2016)</h2>
    
    <div class="embed-container" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/197642743?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    
    <div class="text"><p>A series of musicians are situated along a path winding through the historic jute mills of the Blackness area of Dundee, Scotland. When participants type a message at computer consoles on either end, their words are encoded via rearranged fragments of the &ldquo;Jute Mill Song,&rdquo; a folk work written in 1920 by Dundee mill worker and labor activist Mary Brooksbank. The musicians subsequently pass the music to one another by ear until the message is decoded on the opposite terminal. Along the way, the melodies reverberate in the urban spaces associated with Dundee&rsquo;s industrial past and connect historical textile production with the contemporary labor of computation.</p></div>

    <h2>Arrangement for Building (2014)</h2>

    <div class="text"><p>Modest Mussorgsky&rsquo;s <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em> is performed by a chamber orchestra from Cincinnati&rsquo;s College-Conservatory of Music. Though the musicians are perfectly synchronized in time via networked devices, they are spatially distributed throughout the Contemporary Arts Center building&mdash;they play not only on the distinctive zig-zag staircases and in the gallery spaces that open from floor to floor, but also in the administrative offices, the maintenance rooms, and other concealed areas that are nonetheless essential to the institution. The audience, while prevented from hearing the ensemble as a whole, is invited to roam, encountering intersections of sound as they traverse the space.</p></div>

    <div class="text"><p>In <em>MOCA Grand Prix</em>, game consoles in the plaza let participants race real remote control cars through MOCAâ€™s permanent collection exhibition. The wifi-enabled cars stream back images of Pollocks and Rothkos now appropriated for the background of a retro-style racing game. Awards are presented for the fastest times of the evening.</p></div>

    <div class="text"><p>A carefully choreographed, repeating reenactment allows participants to play the role of Diego Maradona, the Argentine soccer legend who scored the illegal but unpenalized &ldquo;Hand of God&rdquo; goal against England during the 1986 FIFA World Cup. TVs throughout the museum show the event as it is repeatedly remade.</p></div>

    <h2>Hundekopf (2005)</h2>
    
    <div class="embed-container" style="padding-bottom: 75.0%"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/44196570?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    
    <div class="text"><p><em>Hundekopf</em> uses Berlin&rsquo;s Ringbahn as a literary (and literal) vehicle to investigate the nature of private experience in public space. After texting a phone number printed on flyers distributed throughout the city, a participant is told to board a specific train arriving in the next few minutes. Once on the train, <em>Hundekopf</em> knows the location of the participant because it scrapes train times from the BVG alert system [Ed. note: this is before GPS in phones]. Participants receive a text-message after they pass each station on their way around the Ringbahn that is place-specific, and both the landscape outside of the train and the passengers within it are recontextualized into the narrative.</p></div>
